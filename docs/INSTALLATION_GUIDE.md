# MLT Stock Image Assistant Installation & 🗂 Folder Mapping
1. Just double click to install the exe installer.
2. Folder locations are flexible. You can set your own paths in the Settings panel.

| Folder Name      | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PROMPTS_DIR`    | Temporary prompt file (`prompts.txt`). It gets overwritten each run.   |
| `OUTPUT_JPG`     | Clean final images with metadata (for upload to stock platforms).       |
| `OUTPUT_PNG`     | PNGs with detailed metadata (used for regenerating images).             |

## 5. 🔦 Pytorch Installation
1. Open PowerShell (anywhere) and enter
     ```
     nvidia-smi
     ```
2. Read top right of table for something like CUDA 12.9
3. Visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to identify the right python installation code
4. My PC is CUDA 12.9 - Selecting Stable Window pip python cuda 12.6
     ```

     ```
5. After installation, Open PowerShell (anywhere) and enter
     ```
     import torch
     print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print True if CUDA is available
     print(torch.cuda.current_device())  # Should print the GPU device index (usually 0)
     print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))  # Should print the name of the GPU (e.g., "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060")
     ```

### C. SDXL Base & Refiner (EASIEST METHOD ✅)

Instead of manually downloading from HuggingFace:

1. Open PowerShell anywhere, use code below to run ComfyUI:

   cd C:\Users\xxx\Documents\ComfyUI\
   python main.py
   ```

2. In the ComfyUI UI:
   - Top left menu → **Workflow** → **Browse templates** → **SDXL → SDXL Simple**
   - Another path may be:
     - Top left menu → **Workflow** → **Browse templates** → **Image → SDXL Simple**

3. A popup will appear to **auto-download** the required base + refiner models.
   - You may be prompted to visit HuggingFace to agree to terms.
   - Once you do that, ComfyUI will download:
     - `sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors`
     - `sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors`
   - These are automatically placed in `models/checkpoints/`

✅ **Recommended for beginners.**
